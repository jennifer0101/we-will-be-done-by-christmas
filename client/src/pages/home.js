            When a neighbor finds themselves with extra cans of beans, an excess of tomatoes from their garden, or a bunch of cilantro aside from the three tablespoons they used in a recipe that they donâ€™t think they will use, they simply post the items on the Neighborhood Pantry app and the neighbors they have in their group can select which items they may need and arrange a time to stop over and gather them. This will reduce food waste, save neighbors money and time, and promote a community of sharing within the neighborhood.
